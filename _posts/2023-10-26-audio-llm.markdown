## Details
In this session, we're diving into the fascinating world of engineering and audio with a focus on Google's AudioLM model. Our talk will be a deep exploration where we break down the model, understand its core components, and even get hands-on with some PyTorch code. We'll start by demystifying analog and digital signals, grasping the concept of codecs, and how music is turned into data. Then, we'll get into the nitty-gritty of SoundStream. Moving on, we'll take a quick look at generative models, their key players, and how decoders play their part. Hold onto your seats as we go through a simple PyTorch implementation of decoder layers. Lastly, we'll merge the world of audio and generative models with AudioLM. We'll revisit SoundStream, demystify how audio conditioning works, and even do a brief PyTorch demo. Get ready for a blend of audio and engineering that's both informative and engaging!
